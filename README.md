Hi, I am Jakub Wójtowicz
and a teenage programming enthusiast who is constantly trying to learn something new.
I have always been interested in computers and how they work, so when I got the opportunity to learn from the Internet,
I immediately took advantage of it. I wrote my first code at the age of 10 and it was in HTML
(at that time I did not distinguish Java from others and was convinced that it was Java :) ),
and the next steps were in Java SE.
